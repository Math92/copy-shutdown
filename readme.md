README - Copy and Auto Shutdown Script
Description
This Python script, converted into an .exe executable, detects the insertion of a USB device, copies specific files from that device to the PC, and then automatically shuts down the computer. The script now includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easier interaction.



Prerequisites
Windows 10: This executable is designed to work on Windows 10.
Administrator Privileges: To allow the executable to shut down your system, it must be run with administrator privileges.
Initial Setup
Download the Executable: Download the CopyAutoShutdown.exe file to your computer.
Script Execution

Open the Executable:
Double-click on CopyAutoShutdown.exe to start the program.
Using the Graphical Interface:
Follow the instructions in the graphical interface to select a USB/CD device and a destination folder for the files.

Copy and Shutdown Process:
After selecting the files, the program will initiate the file copying process followed by a countdown for shutdown.


Additional Notes
Data Security: Ensure that the files you wish to copy do not contain sensitive or confidential information, as the program does not discriminate the type of file.
Script Testing: It is advisable to first test the executable in a safe environment to ensure that it works as expected.


Emergency Stop: If you need to stop the shutdown after running the program, you can do so by selecting the corresponding option in the graphical interface.
